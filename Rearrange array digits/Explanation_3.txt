This problem required me to maximize the sum of two formed numbers. 
The problem was solved by iterating through the array and then I stored the frequencies of all the digits from 0 to 9.
Using the frequencies, I created two numbers from the array and then I joined them to create the list.

Based on this, the time complexity is O(log(n)) and the space complexity is O(1)
