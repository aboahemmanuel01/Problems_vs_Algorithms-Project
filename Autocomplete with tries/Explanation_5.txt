In this problem I made a class for the TrieNode which has the insert and suffixes method. This form of of implementation is similar to that of the tree structure.
The time complexity for the TrieNode to insert a character is O(1) and the space complexity for the TrieNode to insert a character is also O(1).

Again, for the suffixes of a node; the time complexity is O(m^n) and the space complexity is O(m^n). Where n is the number of levels and m is the max number of elements that a level can have.

The time complexity to insert a word is O(n) whereas the space commplexity to insert a word is O(n).

Finally, for find a prefix; the time complexity is O(n) and the space complexity is O(1.)
