# Problems_vs_Algorithms-Project

In this repository, there are solutions to seven (7) different projects related to algorithms. 
The problems cover a variety of topics related to the basic algorithms of the Udacity Data Structures and Algorithms Nanodegree program. 
Each solution contains a clean and efficient code in Python, as well as a text explanation of the efficiency of my code and design choices.

The seven projects in this repo are:
```
1. Finding the Square Root of an Integer
2. Search in a Rotated Sorted Array
3. Rearrange Array Digits
4. The Dutch National Flag Problem
5. Autocomplete with Tries
6. Unsorted Integer Array
7. Request Routing in a Web Server with a Trie
```
